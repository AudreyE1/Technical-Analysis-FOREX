## Problem Description 
In this project, a currency price prediction model for the GBP/EUR pair will be created using concepts and techniques from technical analysis, machine learning and time series analysis. 

## The Data 
Daily currency prices from 4th January 1999 will be sourced from Quandl (https://www.quandl.com/data/BOE/XUDLERS-Spot-exchange-rate-Euro-into-Sterling) using the Quandl-R package or the Quandl API. The data will be analysed using the R Quantmod package should the Quandl-R package be insufficient. 

## Approach 
1.	Get the data
2.	Explore the data through descriptive summaries and visualizations.
3.	Apply technical analysis indicators (e.g. moving averages) to the data
4.	Use standard statistical analysis to test buy and sell signals
5.	Apply machine learning e.g. for price, moving average predict “Go Long”, “Go Short”, “Neutral” (might need Intra-day data)

## Deliverables 
1.	R code
2.	A paper explaining the problem, data, solution approach and any findings.
3.	A slide deck.
